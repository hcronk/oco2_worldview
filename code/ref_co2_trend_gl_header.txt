# FILE DESCRIPTION
# 
# This file contains a snapshot of the Estimated CO2 Daily Global 
# Seasonal Cycle and Trend (ppm) produced by NOAA ESRL as it is used 
# as reference XCO2 to produce the OCO-2/3 relative XCO2 imagery product
# for the NASA Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS).

# As noted below, the native data produced by ESRL "for the last year 
# are subject to change, depending on recalibration of the reference 
# gas mixtures used, and other quality control procedures. Occasionally, 
# earlier years may also be changed for the same reasons."  Due to this possibility, 
# the values used to produce the relative OCO-2 relative XCO2 imagery product 
# are preserved in this file and updated only as the imagery products are updated.

# Questions about the data and how it is produced should be addressed to
# the ESRL point of contact below. Questions about how these data are used 
# to produce relative OCO-2 relative XCO2 imagery can be addressed to

# USE OF NOAA ESRL DATA
# 
# These data are made freely available to the public and the
# scientific community in the belief that their wide dissemination
# will lead to greater understanding and new scientific insights.
# The availability of these data does not constitute publication
# of the data.  NOAA relies on the ethics and integrity of the user to
# ensure that ESRL receives fair credit for their work.  If the data
# are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation,
# ESRL should be informed at the outset of the nature of this work.
# If the ESRL data are essential to the work, or if an important
# result or conclusion depends on the ESRL data, co-authorship
# may be appropriate.  This should be discussed at an early stage in
# the work.  Manuscripts using the ESRL data should be sent to ESRL
# for review before they are submitted for publication so we can
# ensure that the quality and limitations of the data are accurately
# represented.

# RECIPROCITY
# 
# Use of these data implies an agreement to reciprocate.
# Laboratories making similar measurements agree to make their
# own data available to the general public and to the scientific
# community in an equally complete and easily accessible form.
# Modelers are encouraged to make available to the community,
# upon request, their own tools used in the interpretation
# of the ESRL data, namely well documented model code, transport
# fields, and additional information necessary for other
# scientists to repeat the work and to run modified versions.
# Model availability includes collaborative support for new
# users of the models.

# Estimated CO2 Daily Global Seasonal Cycle and Trend (ppm).
# 
# The estimated daily global seasonal cycle and trend value for CO2 are determined
# from the daily averaged CO2 data from the four NOAA/ESRL/GMD Baseline
# observatories.  A smoothed seasonal cycle and a smoothed de-seasonalized trend
# curve are determined for each observatory record at daily intervals.  An
# estimated global seasonal cycle and trend are computed by averaging the four
# individual observatory seasonal cycle and trend curves at each daily interval.
# 
# For details on the curve fitting process see
# https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/mbl/crvfit/crvfit.html
# 
# CO2 is expressed as a mole fraction in dry air, micromol/mol, abbreviated as ppm
# 
# NOTE: In general, the data presented for the last year are subject to change,
# depending on recalibration of the reference gas mixtures used, and other quality
# control procedures. Occasionally, earlier years may also be changed for the same
# reasons.  Usually these changes are minor.
